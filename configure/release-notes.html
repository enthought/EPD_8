<p>When using the new GUI Package Manager, with a pre-existing EPD installation
as the User Python Environment, in some cases Package Manager will fail,
reporting that it is unable to write to the Python environment. This occurs
when the pre-existing EPD installation was installed with administrative (or
&#8220;root&#8221;) permissions.</p>
<p>This issue primarily arises on Mac OS systems where earlier versions of EPD
were installed in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/Library/Frameworks</span></tt> by default, which requires
administrative (&#8220;root&#8221;) access. On Windows machines this error can occur if
EPD was installed to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Python27</span></tt> or a similar directory using
administrative privileges or by a different user. On Linux, this issue arises
if EPD was installed to a system-wide directory that is not owned by the
current user and the current user doesn&#8217;t specifically have write
permissions.</p>
<p>There are three possible workarounds for this issue:</p>
<p>One workaround method is to install a new user Python environment when the
GUI is first started. This environment will be what is referred to as a
&#8220;per-user&#8221; install, meaning that each user gets their own copy and has full
access rights to it. This install is a full EPD 7.3 installation, and any EPD
package or other Python package can be installed into it. The downside is
that it will not contain any custom packages which may already have been
installed into your existing Python environment. Whether this is an issue
depends on how much you have customized your existing EPD installation.</p>
<p>If you have this problem and would like to use this workaround, but have
already started the EPD GUI and have already chosen to use an existing EPD
install, see <a class="reference internal" href="faq.html#changing-interpreter-path"><em>How do I use the GUI with different user Python environments?</em></a></p>
<p>Workaround method two primarily applies to Mac OS systems and is for users
comfortable with the UNIX permission system. This workaround is to change
ownership of the EPD installation to your user account so that you have write
permission. The command looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>chown -R userid /Library/Frameworks/Python</pre>
</div>
<p>where <em>userid</em> is your user ID. This method also works on Linux systems,
though on Linux the earlier installers did not default to using root
permissions, so if the install was installed with root access it is likely
that it was done for a reason. Again, this method should only be used by
users familiar with the UNIX permissions model and the potential security
issues with changing file ownership.</p>
<p>The final workaround method applies to Mac OS and Linux systems. These
operating systems typically include a command named &#8216;sudo&#8217; which allows users
to execute commands with root permission. This command can be used with the
standard <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">enpkg</span></tt> command to install and uninstall Python packages.</p>
<p>For example, to install the package <em>mpich</em>, the command would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo enpkg mpich</pre>
</div>
<p>This command must be used in place of the package manager to install into
EPD environments where the user does not have write permission.</p>

<div class="section" id="indentation-lost-when-copied-from-editor-pasted-into-a-rich-text-editor">
<h3>Indentation lost when copied from editor, pasted into a rich text editor<a class="headerlink" href="#indentation-lost-when-copied-from-editor-pasted-into-a-rich-text-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When indented text is copied or dragged from the Code Editor window, and
pasted or dropped into an HTML-aware document (e.g. gmail in rich-text mode),
then all indentation is lost. Workarounds are (1) to use &#8220;paste and match
style&#8221; (Mac OS); or (2) to switch the targeted editor from rich text
formatting to plain text (e.g. in gmail); or (3) to first paste the text into
a plain text editor such as Notepad, and then copy it from there; or (4) to
use a clipboard utility to ignore or remove HTML formatted data from the
clipboard. What these workarounds have in common is that they force the paste
operation to use the clip&#8217;s correctly indented text format rather than its
incorrectly indented HTML format.</p>

<div class="section" id="editor-python-run-file-behavior-depends-on-whether-file-exists-on-disk">
<h3>Editor / Python: Run file behavior depends on whether file exists on disk<a class="headerlink" href="#editor-python-run-file-behavior-depends-on-whether-file-exists-on-disk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the Code Editor, the Run File command (in the <em>Run menu</em>) acts differently
depending on whether the current editor tab exists as a file on disk.</p>
<p>If it has never been opened or saved as a file (&#8220;untitled&#8221; tab), then each
line is executed as though it had been entered at the IPython prompt. Such
commands run in the <strong>IPython shell namespace</strong>, where they have access to
any names already defined in the shell, including variables and imports.</p>
<p>In contrast, if this file has been opened or saved (filename in tab), the
IPython magic %run command is used to execute the file from disk (after
offering to save any unsaved changes.) The %run command, by default,
creates its own <strong>new namespace</strong> for evaluating the file. The script will
not have access to names already defined in shell.</p>
<p>Thus newly entered code in the editor may behave differently depending on
whether it has ever been saved.</p>
<p>For example, if numpy has already been imported into the Python shell, either
manually in the shell by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or automatically by running the shell in Pylab mode (the default), and
if you type the following in a new (&#8220;untitled&#8221;) editor tab:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">arange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and do the &#8220;Run File&#8221; command, then IPython will execute this line as if
typed in the shell, where it will find &#8220;numpy&#8221;, and create and print the
array. But if you then save the file and run it again, the file will run in
its own namespace, where &#8220;numpy&#8221; is not defined, so the code will fail with a
NameError. The solution, of course, is to include the import in the file.</p>

<h3>Cant drag-and-drop arbitrary file types into the Code Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#cant-drag-and-drop-arbitrary-file-types-into-the-code-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any file which contains text can be opened in the Code Editor with the Open
File command, or by double-clicking its name in the File Browser. However
only files of recognized types (shown in the file type selector at the bottom
left of the Code Editor window) can be opened by dragging them to the Code
Editor.</p>

<p>Previous versions of EPD contained an &#8220;Uninstall EPD 7.x&#8221; Start Menu
shortcut. EPD 8 GUI and its bundled EPD 7.3 user Python environment do not
contain uninstall shortcuts.</p>
<p>To uninstall the GUI, use Add or Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel.</p>
<p>To uninstall the bundled EPD 7.3 user Python Environment (mandatorily or
optionally installed from the EPD 8 GUI depending on whether a previous
version of EPD 7 had already been installed), delete its installation folder
(see <a class="reference internal" href="../quick-start/install_windows.html#install-windows-location"><em>Installation location</em></a>), and manually remove references to it
from the system and user paths.</p>

<h3>Mac OS: How to Uninstall EPD 8<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-os-how-to-uninstall-epd-8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EPD 8 consists of two components: the graphical environment and the user Python environment.
Each of these can be uninstalled independently if desired.</p>
<p>The graphical environment is installed in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/Applications/EPD</span></tt>.  If you do not wish to use
this piece of EPD it can be uninstalled by dragging it to the Mac OS trash can.</p>
<p>The graphical environment requires an installation of the EPD user Python environment.  This
can be an existing EPD 7.x install or a newly installed environmented. When the GUI starts
it will prompt you to install a Python environment if none are available.</p>
<p>If you wish to uninstall a user Python environment, the default location is under each user&#8217;s
account in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Library/EPD</span></tt>. Each Python environment is installed under this directory and
named for the EPD version and machine architecture (&#8216;x86&#8217; for 32-bit and &#8216;x86_64&#8217; for 64-bit).
For example, a 32-bit install of EPD 7.3 is named &#8216;7.3-x86&#8217;.  Drag the folder for the Python
environment you want to remove to the Mac OS trash can.</p>

<h3>Mac OS: GUI crashes when docking task pane (file browser, Python shell)<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-os-gui-crashes-when-docking-task-pane-file-browser-python-shell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A task pane is a subwindow whose frame can be dragged to a new position
within a larger window (&#8220;docked&#8221;), or to float beside the window
(undocked). Three examples in the Code Editor window are the File
browser, the Python shell, and the Documentation Browser. On Mac OS, such
docking or undocking will occasionally cause the GUI to crash. Under
investigation.</p>

<p>A problem in the implementation of the service for detecting changes to open files causes
it to hold too many file handles at once.  As a result, this error can occur in two ways.
One, if many tabs are opened (40+) at once this error may occur.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a similar number of tabs are open and many of the files those tabs are
editing change simultaneously this error may occur.  This most often happens when an
external tool modifies many files in a given directory, such as when a source code
control tool (SubVersion, Git, etc) updates the files in a directory.</p>
