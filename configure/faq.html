tips for using the environment and other specific suggestions.</p>

<span id="faq-epd-vs-epd-free"></span><h2>What is the difference between the EPD and EPD Free installers?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-the-epd-and-epd-free-installers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both installers include exactly the same graphical environment and the same
version of Python in the user Python environment. The only difference is in
the number of Python packages installed by default in the user Python
environment. EPD Free installs over 30 of the most popular packages in
the user Python environment.
Subscribers can then use the Package Manager or the enpkg command line
utility to add any additional packages found in the EPD Subscriber
Repository.</p>
<p>The full EPD installer includes over 100 additional packages from the EPD
Subscriber Repository pre-installed in the user Python environment. The full
installer is provided as a convenience for users who want to install a large
number of packages initially and for corporate licensees who want to speed up
installation by storing a local copy of the full installer.</p>
<p>A full listing of EPD (and EPD Free) packages is available at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epdlibraries.php">EPD Package
Index</a>. All EPD users
can also use enpkg to install thousands of packages from Enthought&#8217;s
selective mirror of <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI - the Python Package Index</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-epd-gui-and-the-user-python-environment">
<span id="faq-epd-arch"></span><h2>What is the difference between the EPD GUI and the User Python Environment?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-the-epd-gui-and-the-user-python-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The EPD 8 working environment consists of two major components: the EPD
Graphical Environment (GUI), and the user Python environment. The user Python
environment is the traditional Enthought Python Distribution, which is a
standard Python environment with additional packages pre-installed. The GUI
is written in Python, but the Python that it runs under is independent of the
user Python environment, and is not user extensible; it only contains those
modules necessary for implementing the EPD 8 GUI.</p>
<div class="figure align-right">
<img alt="../_images/faq-epd-arch-1.png" src="../_images/faq-epd-arch-1.png" />
</div>
<p>The figure to the right depicts this architecture. Notice that the system
runs as two separate processes. The EPD GUI includes an &#8220;IPython front end&#8221;,
specifically IPython&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/qtconsole.html">QTConsole</a>, where
you type commands and read the results. However your python commands are
actually executed in a separate process (the &#8220;IPython kernel&#8221;, which runs in
the user Python environment. This separation has two significant benefits:</p>
<p>First, if anything goes wrong in code being executed in the user Python
environment, it will not impact the GUI and will not result in the loss of
any unsaved changes. From the GUI the user Python environment (&#8220;kernel&#8221;) can
be re-started if needed.</p>
<p>Second, keeping the GUI and user Python environments independent means there
is no risk that package changes to one will cause code in the other to stop
functioning. Updates to the GUI will not affect your user Python environment,
and you can add, update, or remove packages from your user Python environment
without risking the GUI&#8217;s operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-use-the-gui-with-different-user-python-environments">
<span id="faq-change-pyenv"></span><span id="changing-interpreter-path"></span><h2>How do I use the GUI with different user Python environments?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-use-the-gui-with-different-user-python-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first time the EPD GUI is launched it prompts for the selection or
installation of a user Python environment, where all your Python code will
run. This setting is saved in the EPD preferences.ini file and generally does
not need to be changed. (<a class="reference internal" href="#pref-log-file-locations"><em>Where are the preference and log files located?</em></a>)</p>
<p>However you might, for example, decide to try the EPD 8 GUI first with the
EPD 7.3 that is bundled with the GUI, and then later with your previously
installed EPD 7.2 installation. This is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>If you do decide to select a different Python environment, this can be done
by editing the preferences.ini file. To do so, open the file in any standard
text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, vi, or similar) and look for the interpreter
setting. The line will look something like one of these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>interpreter = c:\Python27\pythonw.exe
interpreter = C:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Apps\Enthought Python\7.3-x86\pythonw.exe</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Make sure that you exit the EPD GUI prior to editing this file, as the GUI
will re-write the preferences on exit.</strong></p>
<p>The easiest and safest way to change the interpreter setting is to delete
this line, save the file in the (non-EPD GUI) text editor, then restart the
EPD GUI. You will again be prompted to set up the user Python environment,
and have the option to either select an existing environment or install a new
one.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may directly edit the interpreter setting in
preferences.ini, to specify the path to a different EPD Python interpreter.
On Mac OSX and Linux the path should point to an executable named
python. On Windows the executable name should be pythonw.exe. The
architecture (32- or 64-bit) of this EPD Python interpreter must be the
same as your EPD 8 GUI installation&#8217;s.</p>
<p>If you choose to use an existing EPD, please see <a class="reference internal" href="../quick-start/install_pythonenv.html#using-existing-epd"><em>Using an existing EPD installation as the User Python Environment</em></a>.</p>

<span id="pref-log-file-locations"></span><h2>Where are the preference and log files located?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-are-the-preference-and-log-files-located" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Usually, users will not need to reference these files. Most preferences are
usually set from the Preferences dialog in the GUI. If there is a GUI error,
a dialog should ask you if you want to report it, which should send the
relevant log file to Enthought.</p>
<p>However, if you need to access these files, here are their platform-specific
locations:</p>
