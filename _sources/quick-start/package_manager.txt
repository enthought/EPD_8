Package Manager
===============

The Package Manager is designed to make it easy to discover and manage the
Python packages available with the EPD Subscription service. It provides a
convenient interface for finding and installing available packages, and for
viewing, updating, and removing installed packages.

Please note these key areas of the Package Manager:

 1. **Search bar:** quickly search the names and descriptions of the
 available packages. For example, typing *statistic* immediately filters the
 list down to six packages.
 
 2. **Package filters:** this set of three buttons filters the display to
 show either all packages, all installed packages, or only those packages for
 which updates are available.

 3. **Subscription status:** displays the name of the account currently in
 use and the subscription status of the account. This can be a useful
 troubleshooting tool, if a package is shown as unavailable, that you believe
 should be available. You can set your account information via the
 Preferences window. (Edit->Preferences on Windows and Linux, or
 EPD->Preferences on Mac OS.)

 4. **Update available indicator:** the red exclamation point added to the
 bottom right corner of the SciPy logo indicates that a newer version is
 available for installation. When this indicator is showing, the version
 number shown is the version number available, not the currently installed
 version. (Workaround to see the current version number: look at that
 package with the "Installed" package filter.)

 5. **Installed indicator:** the green checkbox added to the bottom right
 corner of the Traits logo indicates that this package is installed and
 up-to-date.

 6. **More Info, Install buttons:** selecting a package, as shown above for
 SQLAlchemy, provides two additional buttons: a "More Info" button and either
 an "Install" or "Remove" button. "More Info" displays additional information
 about the package such as what is included and the dependencies. Clicking
 "Install" installs the package into your user Python environment or updates
 the package to the most recent version. Conversely, if the package is
 already installed and the button is labeled "Remove" then the package is
 uninstalled.
 
Two other indicator icons may be shown in addition to 4 and 5, but are not
illustrated in the above picture:

* If a red stop-sign is displayed, it indicates that the package is part of
  EPD but is not available to the current user account -- for example, if you
  are not a current subscriber.

* If a question mark in a blue-grey diamond is displayed, this indicates that
  the package is already installed but not available to the current user
  account through the Package Manager. So if you were to uninstall it, the
  Package Manager could not re-install it, given your current user settings.

If you believe that one of these indicators is shown in error, check that the
correct user name and subscription status is shown in the subscription status
area of the Package Manager window (area 3 in the screen image above), or
contact epd-support@enthought.com.
