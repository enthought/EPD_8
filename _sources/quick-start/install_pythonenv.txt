Setting up the User Python Environment and entering Enthought login information
===============================================================================

The second step in installing EPD 8 is to set up the "user Python
environment," where all your Python code will run. This is a standard Python
installation from the Enthought Python Distribution, to which you can also
add additional Python packages. (We call it the "user Python environment"
to distinguish it from the Python used internally by the GUI- these are
separate so that changes to the GUI's Python and changes to your user Python
environment will not conflict with each other. For more details, see 
"What is the difference between the GUI and User Python Environment?".)

When you first launch the EPD 8 GUI, you will see a configuration dialog that
allows you to configure the user Python environment and (optionally) set up 
or specify an Enthought.com account:

The upper portion of the dialog window provides the option either to install
the user Python environment or to use an existing EPD installation. 

.. _using-existing-epd:

Using an existing EPD installation as the User Python Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Users with an existing EPD installation can choose to use that environment,
provided that it is version 7.0 or higher and has the same architecture (32-
or 64-bit) as your EPD 8 GUI. Using an existing installation can be
convenient if you have customized it with additional Python packages. No
changes are made to existing installations. You may update any packages in
this installation using the EPD 8 Package Manager or the `enpkg` command line
tool.

**IMPORTANT: In this early beta release, if you choose to use an existing EPD
installation as your User Python Environment, please perform the following
manual step from a terminal window before you use the EPD GUI's Package
Manager features. (You can do this either before or after installing EPD 8.0
GUI)**::

   enpkg --userpass
   enpkg enstaller

This is a safe operation. The only installed package that this will affect
will be Enthought's `enstaller` package, which manages EPD's package update
mechanism.

**Note:** Users with existing EPD installs, particularly those users running
on Mac OSX, should read this release note:
:ref:`package_manager_with_root_installs`.

Installing a new EPD 7.3 as the User Python Environment
-------------------------------------------------------

Selecting “Install new User EPD Environment” will install a new Enthought Python
environment. The default installation directory for the user Python
environment varies with platform and is changeable to any writable location.
The default install location for each platform is given in the table below:

======================================  ===================================================================================
Windows Version	                        Per-user Install Path
======================================  ===================================================================================
Windows (admin rights, any version)     ``C:\Python27``
Windows XP & Vista                      ``C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\LocalSettings\Apps\Enthought Python\EPDVer``
Windows 7                               ``C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Apps\Enthought Python\EPDVer``
Mac OSX                                 ``~/Library/EPD/EPDVer``
Linux                                   ``~/EPD/EPDVer``
======================================  ===================================================================================

In the above table, *EPDVer* refers to a directory named for the specific
version of the user EPD environment being installed. For this release, the
versions are 7.3-x86 (32-bit) and 7.3-x86_64 (64-bit).


Entering Enthought login information
------------------------------------

The lower portion of the configuration dialog shown above allows you to
optionally provide login information for your Enthought.com account. Accounts
are free to all users and provide access to updates of Python packages via
the EPD 8 Package Manager and the `enpkg` command line tool. If you are
already an EPD subscriber, you can select "I already have an Enthought
account" and enter your username or email, and your password. If you select
"I'll do this later", you can enter these later via the Preferences dialog.
