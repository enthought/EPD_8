Mac OSX Installation
====================

To install on Mac OSX download either of the following EPD 8 installers:

 - **epd_free-8.0-beta-macos-x86.dmg**, (130MB) -
   The EPD Free installer, which includes the GUI, plus 30 of the most popular
   Python packages. These packages are free to everyone. EPD subscribers can
   install additional packages from the EPD repository.
   
 - **epd-8.0-beta-macos-x86.dmg**, **epd-8.0-beta-macos-x86_64.dmg** (350MB) - The full
   EPD installer includes all of EPD Free plus over 100 additional Python 
   packages bundled into the installer. This installer is only available
   to EPD subscribers.

EPD subscribers may choose either installer. The EPD Free installer
is smaller to download and allows subscribers to install additional Python 
packages, using the EPD 8 Package Manager or the enpkg command line utility.
Subscribers have full access to the EPD Python Package repository. The full
EPD installer is provided as a convenience for subscribers who wish to
download the full set of packages at once.

Both the free and full installers are available in 32-bit ("x86"); the 64-bit
("x86_64") version is available only to subscribers. On 32-bit machines, you 
must use a 32-bit installer. On 64-bit machines, you can use either, but we
recommend using the **32-bit version** unless you specifically need the memory 
capacity of the 64-bit version.  The reason is the 64-bit installer does 
not include wxPython, a GUI toolkit relied on by many packages not yet supported 
on 64-bit Mac OSX.

The Mac OSX version of EPD 8 is distributed as a disk image (.dmg) file.
Opening this file displays the installation window shown below. EPD can be
installed by dragging the EPD icon to the Applications folder in the window, 
to the computer Desktop, or to another folder. If you drag it to the
Applications folder, it will show as "EPD" along with your other applications.

Double-click the EPD icon to launch the GUI. Use of EPD 8 is covered by the
EPD End User License Agreement described in license.rft on the disk image.

The installation process wraps up with the installation of the user Python
environment, :ref:`described here <install_pythonenv>`, the first time the
GUI application is started.
