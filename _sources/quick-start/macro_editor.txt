Macro Editor
============

Macros are a quick way to customize and extend the EPD GUI. They can help you
to automate tasks which are frequent or complicated.

Starting with the Record Macro command in the *Tools* menu, you can record a
series of actions, then play the macro back when needed. Most user actions in
the code editor are recordable like this, as are commands entered at the
IPython prompt.

Every macro is saved as a Python script, so you can tweak it, or make its
actions context-sensitive, just by editing its Python script. You can also
write a macro from scratch. The Macro Editor window provides a convenient way
to makes such changes.
