Step-by-Step Installation
=========================

The EPD 8 installation process consists of two phases:

    1. Installation of the graphical environment (GUI), described below, by
    operating system.
     
    2. :ref:`Setting up the User Python Environment <install_pythonenv>`.
    This phase is common to all operating systems and occurs when the
    application is started for the first time. Existing EPD users may choose
    to continue to use their current EPD Python environment. Existing and new
    EPD users may install a new EPD 7.3 environment.
