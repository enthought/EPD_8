Code Editor, Python Shell, and File Browser
===========================================

EPD 8 users spend most of their GUI time in this window. You can write Python
code in the Code Editor, run your code in the Python panel or experiment
line-by-line using IPython’s fast interactive help and discovery.

Please note these key pieces of the Code Editor (more details below):

 1. **File browser pane:** shows one or more directories and any recently opened 
 files. Double-click a file to open it in the Code Editor.
 
 2. **Code editor:** a general purpose text-editor with additional features
 specifically for editing Python code.

 3. **Python pane:** integrates an IPython (Interactive Python) prompt that lets
 you quickly test code, experiment with ideas, and run code directly from the
 editor.

 4. **Editor status bar:** shows information about the the file currently
 displayed in the code editor: line and column (1 and 22, respectively, in
 the image above), file type, and file path and name.
 
The File Browser and Python panes can be dragged and dropped to different
positions within a Code Editor window, or to outside its borders. When you
are dragging a pane, the location where it would dock is hightlighted in
blue. These panes can also be hidden using their small "X" icon, or
hidden/shown from the *View* menu.

Code Editor Features
--------------------

Choice of file type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type of the current file is automatically determined based on the
file’s extension (.py or .c for example) but can be manually changed by
selecting a different type from the popup menu in the editor status bar.
Changing the file type enables language-specific features, such as
auto-completion of Python code and syntax highlighting for many languages.


Syntax checking with Pyflakes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Python files, the editor frequently runs the pyflakes checking utility in
the background, and marks syntax errors/warnings with red/yellow squiggly
underlining.

A small “!” icon in the status bar shows you the total number of errors
and warnings in the current file. If you click this icon, then you will
toggle the error description at the right of each affected line.

Tab completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you type code, you can use the ``Tab`` key to complete the name behind the
cursor. If there are multiple possible completions, a small selection widget
will pop up, allowing you to choose one completion. Tab completion for
imports works as follows::

   from numpy import lin<TAB>

If there is a syntax error in the code, tab completion can fail. Tab
completion is not performed inside comments or strings.

Inline docstrings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the documentation string for a function or class, you can do the
following::

   linspace<TAB>()
   # or
   linspace(<TAB>)
   # or
   linspace()<TAB>

This will show a tooltip with the documentation for the function. However,
once any function arguments are supplied, pressing "Tab" will no longer
display the docstring for the function.  The following case will also not
display documentation::

   linspace(<TAB>
   # some other code below

This is because the code is syntactically wrong since the parenthesis is not
closed. In summary, the best way to get help strings is to finish writing the
function, supply no arguments and hit tab as shown below::

   # Code ...
   
   linspace()<TAB>
   
   # More code.

Goto definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can jump to the definition of the name under the cursor, by pressing
``Ctrl+j`` (or ``Cmd+j`` on Mac OS X). For example::

   from collections import namedtuple
   namedtuple<Ctrl+j>(x=1)

This will open the ``collections.py`` file in another editor tab at the
definition of the function. Note that you can press ``Ctrl+j`` anywhere on the
symbol.  This should also work for variables.


Search/Find Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Find widget (reached from the *Search* menu), contains a small magnifying
glass icon. Click this to specify Find options (Case, Word, Wrap around, and
Regex).


Commenting and uncommenting blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select a block of text using ``Shift+arrow key`` or the mouse, and then use
the "Comment lines" command from the *Edit menu* (shortcut key ``Ctrl+/``;
``Cmd+/`` on Mac OS X) to comment or uncomment the selection. If you want to
simply comment/uncomment the current line, there is no need to select the
block of text.

Code Indentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To indent a block of code, select it, and then press the ``Tab`` key to indent
it to the right, or ``Shift+Tab`` to dedent it to the left.


Bookmarks
^^^^^^^^^

A code editor bookmark (set in the *Window* menu) records all the files which
are open in one or all editor windows, and the cursor position in each file.
This is like a lightweight browser session manager or IDE project manager. It
is not used for marking locations of interest in files.

File browser Features
---------------------

File types
^^^^^^^^^^

By default the file browser shows all recognized source file types (Python,
C/C++, FORTRAN, …). This can be changed to show fewer file types or all
files by using the "Filter" drop-down menu at the top of the file browser.


Top-level paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For convenient access to your most commonly used files, the file browser is
organized by “Top-level Paths”. Initially there is one top-level path for
your OS home directory, and one for “Recent Files”. You can set any
directory as a top-level path by browsing to it, right-clicking, and
selecting “Add this as top level”.

Python shell Features
---------------------

Pylab mode and GUI support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python session is an `IPython QTconsole
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/qtconsole.html>`_. By
default, it starts in Pylab mode with an interactive GUI backend. This
permits you to run and interact with GUI programs while continuing to enter
commands at the IPython prompt (e.g. to inspect or modify the GUI's data).
See `IPython's GUI event loop support
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/reference.html#gui-support>`_.

The default Pylab GUI backend is WX. From the EPD 8 GUI preferences dialog,
you can change Pylab to use an interactive QT4 GUI backend, or to display
non-interactive inline SVG graphics. 

Pylab mode imports more than 900 numpy and matplotlib names into the console
namespace, which can save typing but can lead to confusion when the same
names (e.g. sum, min, max, any, all, int) are also Python builtins.

From the preferences dialog, you can disable Pylab mode. If you do this, you
can still get the benefits of GUI event loop support, by using one of these
IPython "magic" commands: ``%gui wx`` or ``%gui qt`` or ``%gui inline``.

Change directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you right-click in the Python shell, you will see a command to change the
shell’s current directory to match the location of the current file in the Code
Editor; this uses IPython’s magic “cd” command. For example, this can
be convenient when running a demo program which assumes that its data files
are in the current directory.

Running editor text in the Python shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Run* menu contains commands to run the current file, or the currently
selected text, within Python shell (the user Python enviroment).


Interrupting and restarting the user Python environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Run* menu contains a command to Interrupt a program running in the IPython
shell.

The *Run* menu also contains a command to Restart the IPython kernel (user
Python environment). This can be useful if a running program is frozen and
not interruptible, or has corrupted the user Python environment. Note that if
you restart the IPython kernel, all computed values in the Python session
will be lost.
