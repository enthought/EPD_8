Linux Installation
==================

To install on Linux download either of the following EPD 8 installers:

 - **epd_free-8.0-beta-linux-x86.sh**, **epd_free-8.0-beta-linux-x86_64.sh** (160MB) -
   The EPD Free installer, which includes the GUI, plus 30 of the most popular
   Python packages. These packages are free to everyone. EPD subscribers can
   install additional packages from the EPD repository.
   
 - **epd-8.0-beta-linux-x86.sh**, **epd-8.0-beta-linux-x86_64.sh** (400MB) - The full
   EPD installer includes all of EPD Free plus over 100 additional Python 
   packages bundled into the installer. This installer is only available
   to EPD subscribers.

EPD subscribers may choose either installer. The EPD Free installer
is smaller to download and allows subscribers to install additional Python 
packages, using the EPD 8 Package Manager or the enpkg command line utility.
Subscribers have full access to the EPD Python Package repository. The full
EPD installer is provided as a convenience for subscribers who wish to
download the full set of packages at once.

Both the free and full installers are available in 32-bit ("x86") and 64-bit ("x86_64")
versions. On 32-bit machines, you must use a 32-bit installer. On 64-bit machines, 
you can often use either, but we recommend that you use a 64-bit installer. The
reason is that many 64-bit Linux distributions do not include the necessary
32-bit compatibility libraries by default so the 32-bit version will fail to run.

EPD 8 for Linux is distributed as a self-extracting shell script. Once the
file is downloaded the install can be started by executing the following
command (or similar, depending on version)::

    bash epd_free-8.0-beta-linux-x86.sh

The installer will present the EPD End User License Agreement for approval.
If you agree to the license, the next prompt is for the installation
location. The default installation location is ``~/EPD_8.0``.

Once EPD is installed, the GUI can be launched by executing the EPD
application from the application directory. If EPD is installed in
``~/EPD_8.0``, type: ::

    ~/EPD_8.0/EPD 

The installation process wraps up with the installation of the user Python
environment, :ref:`described here <install_pythonenv>`, the first time the
GUI application is started.
