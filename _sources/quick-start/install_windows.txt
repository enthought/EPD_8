Windows Installation
====================

To install on Microsoft Windows download either of the following EPD 8 installers:

 - **epd_free-8.0-beta-win-x86.msi** (140MB) -
   The EPD Free installer, which includes the GUI, plus 30 of the most popular
   Python packages. These packages are free to everyone. EPD subscribers can
   install additional packages from the EPD repository.
   
 - **epd-8.0-beta-win-x86.msi**, **epd-8.0-beta-win-x86_64.msi** (350MB) - The full
   EPD installer includes all of EPD Free plus over 100 additional Python 
   packages bundled into the installer. This installer is only available
   to EPD subscribers.

EPD subscribers may choose either installer. The EPD Free installer
is smaller to download and allows subscribers to install additional Python 
packages, using the EPD 8 Package Manager or the enpkg command line utility.
Subscribers have full access to the EPD Python Package repository. The full
EPD installer is provided as a convenience for subscribers who wish to
download the full set of packages at once.

Both the free and full installers are available in 32-bit ("x86"); the 64-bit
("x86_64") version is only available to subscribers. On 32-bit Windows, you must 
use a 32-bit installer. On 64-bit Windows, you may use either, but we recommend 
that you use a 64-bit installer for performance reasons.

To start the installer, double-click the downloaded file. Verify that the
publisher is listed as Enthought, Inc. and click Run. The first window of the
install wizard should be displayed as shown below:

Read the license terms and, if you agree with them, click "I accept the
terms in the License Agreement" and click Next.

Installation location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on your access rights on the machine the installer will present one
of two displays. If you do not have administrative rights on the machine, you
will see this display:

You can install EPD as a "per-user installation", meaning that it will be 
stored in your own account on this machine, not accessible to other users on the 
machine. The exact installation directory varies depending on your version of 
Windows:

=============== ========================================================================
Windows Version	Per-user Install Path
=============== ========================================================================
Windows XP	``C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\LocalSettings\Apps\Enthought Python``
Windows Vista	``C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\LocalSettings\Apps\Enthought Python``
Windows 7	``C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Apps\Enthought Python``
=============== ========================================================================

If you have administrative rights on the machine, you have the option to
install EPD just for yourself (per-user install as above) or for everyone on
the machine. If you choose to make EPD available to all users you can select
where to install EPD. The default installation path is ``C:\Program
Files\Enthought Python``, except for for 32-bit EPD on 64-bit Windows, in which
case the default is ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Enthought Python``.

In both cases, the last step is to click 'Install' to begin the installation
process. The process may take several minutes depending on your system
configuration.

Once the installation process is complete, EPD 8 is ready to use. The GUI is
launched by selecting EPD Graphical Environment from the Windows Start menu.

The installation process wraps up with the installation of the user Python
environment, :ref:`described here <install_pythonenv>`, the first time the
GUI application is started.
