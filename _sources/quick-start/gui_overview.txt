EPD 8 GUI Overview
==================

This section briefly describes each of the EPD 8 GUI components. Our
intention is that you be able to begin working in the GUI almost immediately,
without much study. The GUI uses standard conventions when possible, so we do
not describe each available feature or command. We do describe some features
which are unusual or may not be as easily discoverable.
