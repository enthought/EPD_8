Recording, Editing, and Writing Macros
======================================

Macros are a quick way to customize and extend the EPD Graphical Environment.
They can help you to automate tasks which are frequent or complicated.

You can record a series of actions as a macro, then play the macro back when
needed. Most user actions in the code editor are recordable like this, as are
commands entered at the IPython prompt.

Every macro is saved as a Python script, so you can tweak it, or make its
actions context-sensitive, just by editing its Python script. You can also write
a macro from scratch.
