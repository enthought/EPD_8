EPD 8 beta Release Notes
========================

This section lists the uncorrected issues known at release time. Where
possible, we suggest workarounds.

.. contents:: Summary of release notes

Resolved Issues - 8.0.4
-----------------------

Package startup scripts installed incorrectly via Package Manager in 8.0.1 and 8.0.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A bug in the Package Manager caused some packages to be installed incorrectly such that
they will not work if started from the command prompt.  This issue affects packages that
add a startup script in the 'bin' directory of the user Python
environment. For example, installing Mayavi results in the addition of a script named 
'mayavi2' being added to the ``bin`` directory. Each of these scripts contain the
path to the Python interpreter to be used when they are run.

In the 8.0.1 and 8.0.2 releases, installing these packages through Package Manager
resulted in the path being set to the Python in the GUI's Python installation
instead of the Python interpreter in the user Python environment.  This will
cause most of these scripts to not run or to run incorrectly.

We recommend uninstalling and re-installing any packages installed via Package Manager
using either of these releases.  

Enpkg --proxy switch does not work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``enpkg`` utility supports a command line switch ``--proxy`` that allows it
to work with some types of HTTP proxy servers.  This is necessary for users
who are behind network firewalls and must use a proxy server to access external
resources.

This issue has been corrected and this option works again.

In-app Account Registration Fails Silently
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the EPD 8 GUI is first started an EPD Setup dialog is display. This dialog allows
the user to create a new account on Enthought.com or use an existing one. When the
'Create Account' button was pressed it would normally work, but would fail silently if
unable to connect to the internet. This has been corrected and an error is correctly
displayed now.

Windows: Mayavi desktop shortcut does not work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows when the full (as opposed to the free) version of EPD 8 beta was installed,
the desktop shortcut to Mavavi2 was created incorrectly.  Clicking the shortcut
resulted in the error message "Windows cannot find the specified file".

This issue has been corrected in this release.  To fix the shortcut, go to the
Package Manager and uninstall, the re-install Mayavi.

Windows (64-bit only): EPD Setup dialog not display when first used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the EPD 8 GUI is started for the first time it display the EPD Setup dialog that
lets the user select an existing EPD environment or install a new one, and configure
an Enthought.com account  On 64-bit Windows systems where the package 'mingw' was not
already installed this dialog failed to display due to a build error with a secondary
package.  

This build error has been corrected.


Resolved Issues - 8.0.3
-----------------------

Failure with locale set to UTF-8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user's locale was setup so that ``LC_CTYPE`` was set to ``UTF-8`` 
the UI would not launch. 

Package startup scripts installed incorrectly via Package Manager in 8.0.1 and 8.0.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A bug in the Package Manager caused some packages to be installed incorrectly such that
they will not work if started from the command prompt.  This issue affects packages that
add a startup script in the 'bin' directory of the user Python
environment. For example, installing Mayavi results in the addition of a script named 
'mayavi2' being added to the ``bin`` directory. Each of these scripts contain the
path to the Python interpreter to be used when they are run.

In the 8.0.1 and 8.0.2 releases, installing these packages through Package Manager
resulted in the path being set to the Python in the GUI's Python installation
instead of the Python interpreter in the user Python environment.  This will
cause most of these scripts to not run or to run incorrectly.

We recommend uninstalling and re-installing any packages installed via Package Manager
using either of these releases.  

   
Inability to scroll help documentation main page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main documentation browser page was not scrollable and this has been
fixed.


Resolved Issues - 8.0.2
-----------------------

Reduced startup time for Package Manager and enpkg utility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The startup time for the graphical Package Manager and the command line enpkg utility
have been significantly reduced when used over slower networks by turning on caching
and compression of the index files.  

Windows: Import of NumPy fails with error "module object has no attribute 'core'"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error occurred if a new user Python environment was installed and the PATH environment
variable was not setup to include the 'Scripts' directory in this installation.  This issue
has been corrected and it is no longer necessary to set the PATH environment variable.

Windows: GUI fails to restart after update on some machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After applying a software update (Help -> Check for Updates) and pressing 'Install and Restart',
the GUI would fail to restart correctly on some machines.  The issue was a missing DLL
dependency that is not always available.  The relaunch mechanism is now less system dependent.

Linux: Installation of user Python environment hangs when installing to existing directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous version if a new user Python environment was installed to an existing directory
the installation would fail. The installation script incorrectly prompted for confirmation of
an installation to an existing directory, resulting in a deadlock.

Resolved Issues - 8.0.1
-----------------------

Linux: UI crashes after 2-3 seconds on Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04 using Unity desktop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A compatibility issue between Qt and GTK caused the EPD 8 GUI to abort after the welcome window
is displayed on some Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 systems.  This issue occurred if the Unity desktop
was being used and the system is set to use the default Qt style.

The EPD 8 GUI now forces the Qt 'Cleanlooks' style if the system default is set to 'default'.


All platforms
-------------

.. _package_manager_with_root_installs:

Package Manager fails with write error on existing EPD environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using the new GUI Package Manager, with a pre-existing EPD installation
as the User Python Environment, in some cases Package Manager will fail,
reporting that it is unable to write to the Python environment. This occurs
when the pre-existing EPD installation was installed with administrative (or
"root") permissions.

This issue primarily arises on Mac OS systems where earlier versions of EPD
were installed in ``/Library/Frameworks`` by default, which requires
administrative ("root") access. On Windows machines this error can occur if
EPD was installed to ``C:\Python27`` or a similar directory using
administrative privileges or by a different user. On Linux, this issue arises 
if EPD was installed to a system-wide directory that is not owned by the
current user and the current user doesn't specifically have write
permissions.

There are three possible workarounds for this issue:

One workaround method is to install a new user Python environment when the
GUI is first started. This environment will be what is referred to as a
"per-user" install, meaning that each user gets their own copy and has full
access rights to it. This install is a full EPD 7.3 installation, and any EPD
package or other Python package can be installed into it. The downside is
that it will not contain any custom packages which may already have been
installed into your existing Python environment. Whether this is an issue
depends on how much you have customized your existing EPD installation.

If you have this problem and would like to use this workaround, but have
already started the EPD GUI and have already chosen to use an existing EPD
install, see :ref:`changing_interpreter_path`

Workaround method two primarily applies to Mac OS systems and is for users
comfortable with the UNIX permission system. This workaround is to change
ownership of the EPD installation to your user account so that you have write
permission. The command looks something like this::

    chown -R userid /Library/Frameworks/Python
    
where *userid* is your user ID. This method also works on Linux systems,
though on Linux the earlier installers did not default to using root
permissions, so if the install was installed with root access it is likely
that it was done for a reason. Again, this method should only be used by
users familiar with the UNIX permissions model and the potential security
issues with changing file ownership.

The final workaround method applies to Mac OS and Linux systems. These
operating systems typically include a command named 'sudo' which allows users
to execute commands with root permission. This command can be used with the
standard ``enpkg`` command to install and uninstall Python packages.

For example, to install the package *mpich*, the command would be::

    sudo enpkg mpich
    
This command must be used in place of the package manager to install into
EPD environments where the user does not have write permission.

Indentation lost when copied from editor, pasted into a rich text editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When indented text is copied or dragged from the Code Editor window, and
pasted or dropped into an HTML-aware document (e.g. gmail in rich-text mode),
then all indentation is lost. Workarounds are (1) to use "paste and match
style" (Mac OS); or (2) to switch the targeted editor from rich text
formatting to plain text (e.g. in gmail); or (3) to first paste the text into
a plain text editor such as Notepad, and then copy it from there; or (4) to
use a clipboard utility to ignore or remove HTML formatted data from the
clipboard. What these workarounds have in common is that they force the paste
operation to use the clip's correctly indented text format rather than its
incorrectly indented HTML format.

Editor / Python: Run file behavior depends on whether file exists on disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Code Editor, the Run File command (in the *Run menu*) acts differently
depending on whether the current editor tab exists as a file on disk.

If it has never been opened or saved as a file ("untitled" tab), then each
line is executed as though it had been entered at the IPython prompt. Such
commands run in the **IPython shell namespace**, where they have access to
any names already defined in the shell, including variables and imports.

In contrast, if this file has been opened or saved (filename in tab), the
IPython magic %run command is used to execute the file from disk (after
offering to save any unsaved changes.) The %run command, by default,
creates its own **new namespace** for evaluating the file. The script will
not have access to names already defined in shell.

Thus newly entered code in the editor may behave differently depending on
whether it has ever been saved.

For example, if numpy has already been imported into the Python shell, either
manually in the shell by typing::

   import numpy
   
or automatically by running the shell in Pylab mode (the default), and
if you type the following in a new ("untitled") editor tab::

   print numpy.arange(5)

and do the "Run File" command, then IPython will execute this line as if
typed in the shell, where it will find "numpy", and create and print the
array. But if you then save the file and run it again, the file will run in
its own namespace, where "numpy" is not defined, so the code will fail with a
NameError. The solution, of course, is to include the import in the file.


Can't drag-and-drop arbitrary file types into the Code Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any file which contains text can be opened in the Code Editor with the Open
File command, or by double-clicking its name in the File Browser. However
only files of recognized types (shown in the file type selector at the bottom
left of the Code Editor window) can be opened by dragging them to the Code
Editor.

Chaco example 'Sample Visualization of Simulated Live Data Stream' does not work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last of the examples listed under the 'Chaco' package fails with the following
error: ::

  AttributeError: 'Viewer' object has no attribute 'Plot'

This is a known issue in the Chaco package and will be fixed in the ETS 4.1.1
release due out by the end of May, 2012.  The Chaco package or ETS as a whole can 
be updated through the Package Manager UI.


Windows
-------

Windows installation: Stalled progress bar for EPD 7.3 (User Python Environment)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, the :ref:`installation of the bundled EPD 7.3 User Python
Environment <install_pythonenv>` (initiated from the EPD 8.0 Graphical
Environment) completes successfully, but the progress bar dialog stalls at
completion. Workaround: wait for 10 minutes to ensure that the installation
is not still running, then quit the EPD GUI and restart it.

Windows: How to uninstall EPD 8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previous versions of EPD contained an "Uninstall EPD 7.x" Start Menu
shortcut. EPD 8 GUI and its bundled EPD 7.3 user Python environment do not
contain uninstall shortcuts.

To uninstall the GUI, use Add or Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel.

To uninstall the bundled EPD 7.3 user Python Environment (mandatorily or
optionally installed from the EPD 8 GUI depending on whether a previous
version of EPD 7 had already been installed), delete its installation folder
(see :ref:`install_windows_location`), and manually remove references to it
from the system and user paths.

Windows on virtual machine in Mac OS: crash on tab completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Repeated tab completion in the code editor can cause the GUI to crash. This
has only been reported in Windows, running in a virtual machine in Mac OS.
Under investigation.

Mac OS
------

Mac OS: How to Uninstall EPD 8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EPD 8 consists of two components: the graphical environment and the user Python environment.
Each of these can be uninstalled independently if desired.

The graphical environment is installed in ``/Applications/EPD``.  If you do not wish to use
this piece of EPD it can be uninstalled by dragging it to the Mac OS trash can.

The graphical environment requires an installation of the EPD user Python environment.  This
can be an existing EPD 7.x install or a newly installed environmented. When the GUI starts
it will prompt you to install a Python environment if none are available.

If you wish to uninstall a user Python environment, the default location is under each user's
account in ``Library/EPD``. Each Python environment is installed under this directory and
named for the EPD version and machine architecture ('x86' for 32-bit and 'x86_64' for 64-bit).  
For example, a 32-bit install of EPD 7.3 is named '7.3-x86'.  Drag the folder for the Python
environment you want to remove to the Mac OS trash can.


Mac OS: GUI crashes when docking task pane (file browser, Python shell)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\

A task pane is a subwindow whose frame can be dragged to a new position
within a larger window ("docked"), or to float beside the window
(undocked). Three examples in the Code Editor window are the File
browser, the Python shell, and the Documentation Browser. On Mac OS, such
docking or undocking will occasionally cause the GUI to crash. Under
investigation.


Mac OS: "Too many files open" error in Code Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A problem in the implementation of the service for detecting changes to open files causes
it to hold too many file handles at once.  As a result, this error can occur in two ways.
One, if many tabs are opened (40+) at once this error may occur.  

Similarly, if a similar number of tabs are open and many of the files those tabs are 
editing change simultaneously this error may occur.  This most often happens when an 
external tool modifies many files in a given directory, such as when a source code 
control tool (SubVersion, Git, etc) updates the files in a directory.

Linux
-----

Linux: installation issue 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux, the installation script fails if it is run in a directory whose
name contains spaces. This is not supported at present.

Linux: EPD GUI does not start: ImportError: libpng12.so.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On some very new linux distributions (most notably Fedora 17), a newer
version of libpng is installed by default which is not yet compatible with
EPD GUI. You may see the following error message on the console on
starting the GUI::

   ImportError: libpng12.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You need to install the libpng 1.2 compatibility library to run EPD GUI
using the following command::

   su -c "yum -y install libpng-compat"

Other distributions not having the libpng compatibility library need
to follow similar steps.
