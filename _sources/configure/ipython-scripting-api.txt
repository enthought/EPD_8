IPython Pane Scripting Commands
================================

As described at :ref:`Recording, Editing, and Writing Macros <macro_intro>`,
macros are Python scripts which automate tasks in the EPD Graphical Environment.

*Please note that the scripting API in this beta version of EPD 8 GUI is
likely to change in future releases. We plan for all recorded macros to be
supported, but other current scripting commands may be changed.*

Here are several commands which you can use to script some common IPython actions.

.. method:: execute_command(command, hidden=False)

   Executes a command at the IPython prompt.

   If ``hidden`` is True, then the command is executed without displaying any 
   input or output in the IPython interpreter.
   
   If you enter a command at the IPython prompt while you are recording a macro,
   it will be recorded in the macro script as a call to this method. (At
   present, this is the only recordable action in the IPython panel.)

   ::

       code_task = get_active_task()
       python_pane = code_task.python_pane
       python_pane.execute_command(u'print "hello world"\n')

.. method:: execute_file(path, hidden=False)

   Executes a file at the IPython prompt.
   
   If ``hidden`` is True, then the file is executed without displaying any 
   input or output in the IPython interpreter.   

   ::

       code_task = get_active_task()
       python_pane = code_task.python_pane
       python_pane.execute_file('/tmp/script.py')

.. method:: history_tail(count)

   Returns a list of the final ``count`` entries from the end of the local 
   IPython history list.

   ::
   
        # Repeat the next-to-last command at the IPython prompt.
        # (Invoke this repeatedly to alternate between two commands):
        code_task = get_active_task()
        python_pane = code_task.python_pane
        python_pane.execute_command(python_pane.history_tail(2)[0])
