Welcome to EPD 8 Beta
=====================

Welcome to EPD 8.0 Beta! We are excited about this release, which includes
a brand-new graphical environment (GUI) focused on the needs of scientists
and engineers. The new capabilities include a power text editor with
integrated IPython prompt, a Python package manager to make it easier to find
and install packages, integrated online help, and macro scripting
capabilities. The EPD 8 interface is designed to provide a lightweight,
easy-to-learn Python development environment for scientists, engineers, and
analysts, in contrast to more complex tools for larger application
development teams.

The EPD 8 beta program is focused on evaluating the quality and usability of
the new GUI. In short, how are we doing towards the goal? We very much
appreciate your taking the time to help us evaluate it and provide your
feedback. Question, problems, and comments can be sent to
beta-feedback@enthought.com.

We will be updating the GUI with improvements and fixes periodically during the
beta period.  This is done using the integrated update mechanism described
in :ref:`updating_the_epd_gui`.

The rest of this document falls into two major sections -- a Quick Start Guide
for those wishing to get running as quickly as possible, and Advanced Topics,
providing more details and background information.
